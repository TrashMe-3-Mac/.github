## What is TrashMe 3?  

**TrashMe 3** is an advanced **application uninstaller and system maintenance utility** designed to keep your device clean, optimized, and organized. It goes far beyond basic app removal — locating and deleting every hidden file, cache, or leftover that typical uninstallers miss.  

With its intuitive interface, TrashMe 3 helps you reclaim valuable storage space by removing unused apps, old files, duplicate content, and large forgotten items. Its smart search engine scans your disk for unnecessary data and gives you clear insights into what’s taking up space.  

In addition to uninstalling software, TrashMe 3 features powerful modules for **memory optimization, startup management, disk monitoring**, and **file protection**. You can mark apps as favorites, exclude them from scans, or monitor system health in real time.  

Optimized for **Apple Silicon**, TrashMe 3 runs efficiently, providing fast cleanup operations without impacting performance. It’s a trusted solution for users who want to maintain a tidy, responsive, and efficient workspace every day.
